# H4, Fourth class week

## Notes from class

* Hail-Mary- attack: throw every attack towards the target and listen what comes back
    * it is bad because:
        * it might crash the target system and make it unreachable
        * it might reveal you and make the target wary

* Reconnaisance:
    * passive: looking publicly available information 
    * active: looking secret information, might use special tools

* How to do recon?
    * social engineering
    * phishing
    * browse the net for information
    * defcon-story, using only osint, gaining "flags" over the phone in 20 min
    * searching hacking sites, tor
    * person names, email addresses (pivoting, all info helps)

## Homework

Course's homepage is [terokarvinen.com](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/#h4) with the assignments. As a starter, a fair warning from the course's assignments:

"intelligence gap

Be careful with the tools. Only use tools to practice targets inside practice networks separated from the internet. Just port scanning someone else's computer might be a crime, KKO 2003:36. Be careful with IP addresses. If you install Kali, don't run random tools when your computer is connected to the Internet"

My host computer runs Windows 11 Pro, my main virtual machine is Linux Debian 11 (64-bit) (in these assignments "the attacker's" or "pentester's" computer) and the vulnerable target is Metasploitable 2 (Linux Debian (64-bit)) virtual machine. The port scanning happens in host-only network between the virtual machines (from main VM to Metasploitable 2) and the internet connection is disabled during scanning just in case.

### z - reading, watching and listening

**Assignment**:

"Read (or watch or listen) and summarize (This subtask z does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like)

"

1\. Santos et al. videos: Passive Reconnaisance (3.0-3.4):

* passive recon: not sending any information to the target network: i.e. no scans etc.
* Hackers and pentesters can find open ports on target's external network, their employees and passwords from public breaches without doing active recon
* Recon phase should not be skipped because you might miss a vulnerability.
* Pentesters need to be sure what their scope is so they don't do anything that was not agreed upon.

**Search publicly available data**:
* search: site:example.com -site:www.example.com to find more unpopular sites like test sites or dev sites
* certificate transparency: you'll find what systems have been issued with certificates
* guess hostnames with terminal tool: nslookup test.example.com
* regional internet registries, find subnets and technical contacts
* netcraft and shodan and censys.io searches reveal e.g. open ports

**Searching for files**:
* search: site:example.com pdf or search: site:example.com filetype:xlsx
* password files, search: site:example.com inurl:etc -intext:etc ext:passwd
* files contain important metadata: discover usernames and version software
* ExifTool to find file's metadata

**Searching for names passwords and sesitive information**:
* public breaches: adobe, linkedin, dropbox --> pentester can try if passwords are still in use
* search: pastebin.com
* https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database has help for looking for sensitive information

2\. Santos et al. videos: Active Reconnaisance (4.0-4.3)

* Active Enumeration starts, that is when packets are sent information to target network, might set off alarms if someone is looking for logs.
* Pentesters usually start "quietly" and continue louder to test if their presence is noticed and at what point.

**Methodology**:
* Port Scanning
* Web Service Review
* Vulnerability Scanning, should be done in the end of the recon phase to not to set off any alarms too early

**Port scanning**: 
* nmap (tool that is versatile and stable)
* Masscan (fastest port scanner)
* Udpprotoscanner (for udp-services)

**Web Service Review**:
* EyeWitness: helps with prioritizing which web services to focus on, takes screenshots of the pages

3\. Lyon 2009, chapter 15

nmap-tool divides the ports into six states:

1. open: "An application is actively accepting TCP connections, UDP datagrams or SCTP associations on this port.--"
2. closed: "--is accessible -- but there is no application listening on it", might open up later, might be better to be protected by a firewall by admins (and then they would appear as "filtered")
3. filtered: nmap cannot determine if port is open, provide no useful information to the attacker and slows down the scans
4. unfiltered: port is accessible but nmap is not sure if it is open or closed
5. open|filtered: nmap cannot determine if port is open or filtered
6. closed|filtered: nmap cannot determine if the port is closed or filtered

### a - My networks

**Assignment**:

"Add a new vboxnet internal network to your VirtualBox (File: Host Network Manager...)"

Added a Host-Only Network Adapter:

![host_only](/assets/h4/file_host.png)

### b - Punchbag

**Assignment**:

"Install Metasploitable 2 practice target on Virtual Box, and only connect it to your new virtual network. Login to Metasploitable 2 and find out its IP address."

I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLMdvpv7aTM) to help me with the installation, though, it was familiar process because it was basically same as in installing the Debian virtual machine. The main difference was that one must connect the Metasploitable 2 VM to the host-only network.

I downloaded the Metasploitable 2 from https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/ (last modified 2019-08-19).

I created a new virtual machine and used the Metasploitable virtual hard disk file (vmdk) and specified that it is a Linux Debian (64-bit) with 1024 Mbit memory.

![vm](/assets//h4/metasploit_asetukset.png)

Then, I connected it to the host-only network.

![host_only](/assets/h4/network_host_only.png)

I logged in with msfadmin/msfadmin and asked for the ip address with:

> ip a

![ip](/assets/h4/metasploit_ip.png)

And I got that the ip address is 192.168.56.3. Because it is 192.168.x.x-address it is a private (non-routable) IPv4-address (hint from course's assignments) like we wanted, because we do not want to run Metasploitable 2 in an untrusted network.

Course [website's](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/#h1) hint, h4:

"Private (non-routable) IPv4 addresses start with 127.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x, 10.x.x.x. or 192.168.x.x Check that Metasploitable IP address is in one of these. Note that your local production network might use the same addresses for something important, especially at work."

### c - Hero arrives

**Assignment**:

"Connect the Linux computer you've been using to the same network (e.g. Debian 11-bullseye)."

Course [website's](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/#h1) hint, h4:

"To connect your attack VM (e.g. Debian Bullseye) to your test network: shut down the VM, add another virtual network card (connected to virtual network vboxnetN)."

Connecting the other virtual machine to the same host-only network:

![other_host_only](/assets//h4//debian_host_only.png)

Now, the virtual machines can communicate with each other in the same host-only network. 

### d - Hello sploitable!

**Assignment**:

"Open the website on Metasploitable 2 (from your main VM, e.g. Debian). If you can't open the expected website, you're not looking at the correct computer, don't run any scans or any similar tests."

Course [website's](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/#h1) hint, h4:

"Metasploitable 2 has a web server in default port. The address is just http and the IP address. If the IP address of Metasploitable 2 was 192.168.43.21, then you should see the web server at http://192.168.43.21. The front page shows a large "metasploitable2" text, and the text "Never expose this VM to an untrusted network". If you don't see this, you're not looking at the right computer, don't scan it."

To the the Debian virtual machine's internet's address bar, I wrote the ip address I got from my Metasploitable 2 VM (Metasploitable 2 VM is running):

> http://192.168.56.3

And got this response:

![site](/assets/h4/metasploit_site.png)

So, I was able to succesfully connect to the right target and it was safe to scan it.

### e - Scanalyses

**Assignment**:

"Port scan Metasploitable 2. Analyze the results. This is a big task: explain all you can understand from the results. Is there something untypical for a server publicly visible on the Internet? Do you think some services could be especially vulnerable, a good start for the initial foothold? You explation should take the main part of your answer. Make sure you only port scan the correct computer. Disconnect your host computer from the Internet as needed."

Course [website's](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/#h1) hint, h4:

"'sudo nmap -v -A -p- localhost -oA myscan' # -v is verbose; -p- scans all tcp ports; -A (aaand kitchen sink) runs scripts, does OS fingerprint, is very loud; -oA myscan save all output formats in current directory with names starting with myscan."

I installed the scanning tool "Nmap" with:

> sudo apt install nmap

Then, I disconnected my internet connection from my host computer.

First, I scanned my localhost's 1000 most common ports (in my main Debian VM):

> sudo nmap localhost

And the result was:

![nmap_local1](/assets/h4/nmap_localhost.png)

Localhost's (here, the target) ip address was 127.0.0.1. From the results we can see that the scan happened very quickly (in 0.07 seconds), which should be expected because we scanned our own computer. The scan found three open ports with services: smtp in port 25, http in port 80 and postgresql in port 5432. Smtp-service (short message tranfer protocol) is for email routing ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol)). Http-service is for internet protocol suite ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)). And PostgreSQL- service is for PostgreSQL-database. I'm not sure why my localhost has this service.

Next, I did the more "loud" and "take everything" scan for my localhost:

> sudo nmap -v -A -p- localhost -oA myscan

And part of the result was:

![nmap_local2](/assets/h4/nmap_localhost2.png)

The scan's result was saved to three files ('-oA'-switch myscan): myscan.nmap, myscan.xml and myscan.gnmap. And the contents I read with:

> less myscan.nmap

Part 1 of the myscan.nmap-file:

![nmap_local3](/assets/h4/nmap_local3.png)

All the ports were scanned. It found the same three open ports (25, 80, 5432) and gave more information, like the versions (for smtp version was Exim smtpd 4.94.2 and for http version Apache httpd 2.4.52 (Debian).) It also gave supported methods for the ports, like 'POST OPTIONS HEAD GET' for http. 

I'm not sure what information I can safely show here, but as I understand from the output, for the postgresql-service it showed some signature algorithm type (sha256, very secure, validity date). 

The scan also revealed that the target (localhost) has a Linux OS but I think the OS details might be wrong, I installed 11.2.0-version but the scan said the OS details were Linux 2.6.32. And there were 0 network hops because the scan was for the localhost. 

![nmap_local4](/assets/h4/nmap_local4.png)

After this practise it was time to scan the actual Metasploitable 2- target.

I started with the 1000 ports' scan to the Metasploitable 2's ip address (192.168.56.3):

> sudo nmap 192.168.56.3

And the results were:

![nmap_meta1](/assets/h4/nmap_metasploit.png)

And the scan revealed that the target has quite a few open ports with many services, like ftp, telnet, domain, exec, login, mysql etc.

First, I need to understand what some of these services are ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers))

**What are these ports for**:

21: File Transfer Protocol (command) <br>
22: Secure Shell, secure logins, file transfers (scp, sftp) and port forwarding <br>
23: telnet, unencrypted text communications <br>
53: domain, DNS <br>
111: rpcbind, Open Network Computing (ONC) Remote Procedure Call (RPC), which probably should not be open ([source](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/80799/security-risk-of-opening-port-111-rpcbind)) because it reveals what program numbers and services and ports are running and apparently this service has known vulnerabilities. <br>
139: NetBIOS Session Service, "--is a protocol that allows communication of files and printers through the Session Layer of the OSI Model in a LAN" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS)), but apparently it should not be open ([source](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/The-dangers-of-open-port-139)) because the target does not even have Windows operating system (we know it is Linux)(?).<br>
445: Microsoft-DS (Directory Services) Active Directory, Windows shares, so, apparently there is Windows machines in the target machine (?) and it has been used as a entrypoint for a virus, The WannaCry ransomware ([source](https://www.how2shout.com/how-to/port-445-what-is-the-use-and-how-to-disable-this-tcp-port.html)) and it should be disabled.<br>
512 & 513: exec, rlogin, "The Berkeley r-commands are a suite of computer programs designed to enable users of one Unix system to log in or issue commands to another Unix computer via TCP/IP computer network" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands)). Apparently, it has remote access execution possibilities ([source](https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=512)) and it sounds very dangerous to expose these to the internet.<br>
514: Remote Shell, it is a command line program that can execute shell programs ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Shell)) and it doesn't sound like something that should be visible to the internet.<br>
1099: rmiregistry, Java remote method invocation (RMI) registry. Apparently, this port causes a vulnerability: "--This could allow remote access to all JVM properties of Composition bundle, including unencrypted database user and password. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could later use those credentials to access database server.--" ([source](https://customer.precisely.com/s/article/Vulnerability-arising-from-exposed-Java-RMI-port-1099-on-EngageOne-Server?language=en_US))<br>
1524: ingreslock, Ingres is a RDMS. Apparently, port 1524 is used by trojans as a backdoor ([source](https://sensorstechforum.com/remove-ingreslock-backdoor-and-lock-tcp-1524/)) and should not be exposed to the internet.<br>
3306: mysql, it is for RDBMS i.e. database and it should not be exposed like this ([source](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/mysql-port/)).<br>
8009: Apache JServ Protocol (ajp13), should not be exposed because it can be used to gain access or execute code on the application server.<br>

**What would a hacker do**:

At this point, I realized that there are so many potential vulnerabilities and possibilities for unauthorized access that I am not exactly sure where I would start if I was an attacker. Maybe it would depend on what was my agenda? I could try to steal data from databases by trying to gain access from communicating through ports 1099 (rmiregistry), 3306 (mysql)? Or, then I could just let myself in to the whole Apache server using some attack through the port 8009 and do whatever I want with the server?

I also tried the more loud and thorough scan against Metasploitable 2:

> sudo nmap -v -A -p- 192.168.56.3 -oA metascan

A part of the results:

![nmap_meta2](/assets/h4/nmap_metasploit2.png)

From the metascan.nmap-file we saved:

![metafile1](/assets/h4/nmap_metafile1.png)

From this part of the results, I'm guessing that with 21/tcp (ftp service) we were allowed to login anonymously to the service and we could feed as many files as we wanted since there is no bandwidth limit. So, could we do a DoS-attack to this port?

From 25/tcp (smtp) (not shown in picture) I could see from the ciphers that there were a lot of "MD5"'s which is a weak encryption algorithm but I do not know what I would do with that information (I could decipher data from this port easily?). 

Second part of the metascan.nmap-file:

![metafile2](/assets/h4/nmap_metafile2.png)

For all of the services, I can see version numbers, which could reveal more specific vulnerabilities. A search revealed that there are actually a lot of vulnerabilites in these Samba- versions ([cvedetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-102/Samba.html)) that can be used for excessive CPU usage leading to DoS-vulnerability (CVE-2020-10745) among other things. 

For 3306/tcp (mysql) version 5.0 51a 3ubuntu5 there are exploits ready-made that causes unspecified remote code-execution ([source](http://www.securityspace.com/smysecure/catid.html?id=1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.100436)) and from what I can understand from the scan, the scripts run succesfully connected with the database (ConnectWithDatabase) and **does the "Status: Autocommit" mean that there are no measures in monitoring what gets written into the database?**

Third part of the metascan.nmap-file:

![nmap_metafile3](/assets/h4/nmap_metafile3.png)

With the 8009/tcp (ajp13) there seemed to be a test that failed, so, does that mean that there was a protective measure (like a password) and an access was denied? **But maybe an attacker could still try some default passwords to gain access to the server?** 

Fourth part of the metascan.nmap-file:

![nmap_metafile4](/assets/h4/nmap_metafile4.png)

From this part I wondered, where these host names could be useful, like "metasploitable.localdomain", "irc.Metasploitable.LAN"?

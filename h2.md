# H2, Second course week

In the second lesson, we took a look at last week's homework and got some feedback. Major feedback for me was that I need to include more photos from the exercises that are done on the computer, e.g. installations, terminal- screenshots and the results. We also solved some problems other students had, like being unable to add Guest Additions (for Linux installations part) or being unable to install the VirtualBox itself. 

The new theory part was about the OWASP Top 10- vulnerabilities. To be able to protect against them, we need to understand the vulnerabilities, common attacks and ways to mitigate the threats. This week's homework has some reading material about OWASP Top 10, listening one podcast from "Darknet Diaries" and picking and understanding one CVE (The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Then we practise/recap some SQL in SQLZoo and do some hacking with WebGoat.

1. [A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

* Over 90 % of applications, that OWASP tested, had some security misconfiguration
* Security Misconfiguration takes on many forms, some of which are:
    * Improperly configuried permissions
    * Unnecessary features enabled or installed, e.g. ports, services, pages etc.
    * Default accounts and passwords remain and are unchanged (attackers will know default/common passwords and accounts)
    * Revealing too much, e.g. in stack traces or error messages, or directory listing is not disabled on  the server
    * It is a security misconfiguration to use vulnerable or outdated components (see OWASP A06:2021)

2. [A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)

Applications are, nowadays, mostly not written/coded by a single developer/team because they are often huge and complex. Instead, they have components and dependencies that have come from the outside, e.g. libraries and repositories that someone else made. All programs and software has bugs and vulnerabilities get discovered. The problems start when pathches are not made (components that are not updated any more) or programs don't get updated (because developer does not follow security bulletins or does not remember what components they have used or are unable to configure the patches correctly). 

* Versions of the components and their dependencies must be known. There needs to be an inventory. There needs to be vulnerability scans.
* Removing components and dependencies that are not needed.
* Using trusted and official sources over secure links.
* Remember that there can be components on the internet that have been specifically **designed** to create a vulnerability.

3. [A03:2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)

4. [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)

* Listened to a story, where a physical pentester, Jason, breaks into a wrong bank accidentally ([Ep 6: The Beirut Bank Job](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/6/)).
* Physical pentesters use social engineering and confidence to get people to trust them, which allows them to do what they want and gain access to places they should not be allowed to go.
* Pentesting (and the possible attacker's) tactics include: walking with determination like you know where you're going, gaining trust by being seen coming from a "trusted side" (like the direction of boss' office or break room), wearing fake badges, having fake email as documentation for a job they're supposedly doing, walking through closed doors after someone...
* To protect againt these tactics, the simplest way is to train staff to always be wary or suspicious of strangers in the workplace and encourage them to act firmly when asking for documentation (people are often too afraid to seem "rude"). Security policies should include awareness training.

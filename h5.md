**Tips**:

* Presentations start w09
* Audience: your classmates. (What would you like to hear?)
* 10 min - 15 min
* Tero publishes the schedule on w09
* The butler did it! Put the main thing first. Audience must understand "what's in it for me". If you're doing a demo, it's often a good idea to start it right away.
* O'Reilly Learning â‚¬ (former Safari) is a bit pricey, but Haaga-Helia students get free access trough Haaga-Helia library A-Z page.
* Of course you will not be reading your presentation plan word for word, but it will help your audience to conctrate when they don't have to write a lot of notes when you speak).
* Who is Bruce Schneier? Might want to check his blog, too.
* No classes on winter holiday w08. As always, the report is due 24 h before the next class, so that's after the holiday, w09.

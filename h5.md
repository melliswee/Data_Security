# H5, Fifth course week


## z - Reading 

**Assignment**:

"
Read (or watch or listen) and summarize (This subtask z does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like)

* Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: [Chapter 1: Foundations](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/08_chap01.html#chap01-sec001)
"

* message in plaintext -> encryption (or enciphering) -> ciphertext -> decryption (or deciphering) -> message in plaintext
* cryptographic algorithm = cipher
* Cryptography gives confideality but sometimes also:
    * authentication, ascertaining origin of the message
    * integrity, message has not been tampered with
    * nonrepudiation, sender is unable to deny sending the message
* Restricted algorithm relies on keeping the way the algorithm works a secret.
* In modern cryptography a **key** is used, thus the security is based on keys, not in the details of the algorithm. So, it does not matter if an eavesdropper knows the algorithm because they do not know the key. 
* General types of key-based algorithms:
    * symmetric: The sender and the receiver need to agree on the key first and then use it to communicate securely. The key must remain a secret.
        * stream algorithms
        * block algorithms
    * public key (asymmetric): There are different keys for encryption and decryption. The encryption key is public and the decryption key is private.
* It is assumed that the attacker or cryptanalyst has a complete knowledge of the encryption algorithm.
* Cryptanalytic attacks (there are others than listed here):
    * Ciphertext-only attack: has ciphertext of several messages, tries to recover plaintext or deduce the key
    * Known-plaintext attack: has ciphertext and plaintext of several messages, tries to deduce the key
    * Chosen-plaintext attack: has previous but also chooses the plaintext to be encrypted
    * Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack: has previous but can also modify their choice according to the results the previous encryption

## a - Presentation material 

**Assignment**:

"
Write down synopsis and key points of your presentation. Add some references. If you're using slides, feel free to link the PDF here in addition to synopsis.

**IoT and Security**

Synopsis:

Things that have been "dumb" are becoming "smart". IoT devices promise more efficiency, ease of use, more data about your health and even security. Industries can streamline their processes with smart sensors, AI and cloud services, athletes can read their performance data from their watches, drivers can rest easy when the car takes over the driving and homeowners can check on their house or summer cottages or perhaps see how their new puppy is doing at home. But it seems that not all the new smart devices are secure because the more interconnected everything is, the more there is attack surface to find for hackers and security researchers to consider. There have been several examples of IoT security breaches that reveal how bad an attack can become if IoT devices are not secured. The Mirai Botnet was used for DDoS attacks that caused the internet internet service to go down. Smart health devices like pacemakers can have security issues that can cause a serious health risk for the patient or then home security system can have vulnerable surveillance cameras that stream their feed to the internet for everyone to see. Often these risks are caused by very basic flaws in devices software or configuration. IoT devices can utilize default credentials that cannot be changed or the user does not change it, the software has bugs but regular security patches are not installed or the device has a WiFi network that is not protected or the passwords are in cleartext format. To know all of these things exist, makes a developer (to-be like me) more wary and savvy.   

Points:

* What is IoT
* IoT security breach examples
* Suggested security measures

## b - Encrypt and decrypt a message using a tool of your choosing. Comment on the tool and the process.

**Tips**:

* Presentations start w09
* Audience: your classmates. (What would you like to hear?)
* 10 min - 15 min
* Tero publishes the schedule on w09
* The butler did it! Put the main thing first. Audience must understand "what's in it for me". If you're doing a demo, it's often a good idea to start it right away.
* O'Reilly Learning â‚¬ (former Safari) is a bit pricey, but Haaga-Helia students get free access trough Haaga-Helia library A-Z page.
* Of course you will not be reading your presentation plan word for word, but it will help your audience to conctrate when they don't have to write a lot of notes when you speak).
* Who is Bruce Schneier? Might want to check his blog, too.
* No classes on winter holiday w08. As always, the report is due 24 h before the next class, so that's after the holiday, w09.

# First course week

In the first lesson of this course we learned that security is an adversarial endeavour. During this course we will also gain some hands-on experience with security tools. We will be using Linux Debian 11- Bullseye and WebGoat as a practise target.
<br></br>
For more detailed description of the course and individual homework assignments, visit our teacher's [website](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/). 
<br></br>
First homework consists of reading, making some remarks about them, giving the ["Over The Wire: Bandit"](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) a go, installing Debian virtual machine in VirtualBox, then installing WebGoat and solve a couple of challenges on WebGoat and writing this log or diary about all of the successes and triumphs but all of the trials and tribulations as well. 
<br></br>
I have used some Markdown before but I still need more practise. For recap, I'm reviewing another course's project, [StashHunters](https://github.com/Myyyra/StashHunters), where we made a good documentation for it. I will be using [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as a reference too.

[Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf), chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action

**Comments and notes**

* Conventional network defence tools are insufficient against advanced and **persistent** threats. Defenders need to mitigate threat component risk as well as vulnerabilities.
* Intrusion kill chain consists of

    1\. reconnaissance: research and identify<br>
    2\. weaponization: coupling deliverable with an exploit with the payload (=weaponized deliverable)<br>
    3\. delivery: transmission of weapon, vectors can be email attachments, websites and USBs<br>
    4\. exploitation: triggering intruder's code<br>
    5\. installation: installing remote access or backdoor to establish a persistence<br>
    6\. command and control (C2): beacon outbound to establish "hands on the keyboard"<br>
    7\. actions on objectives: finally doing the objectives in the host like collecting data
    <br></br>
    (btw, the list converted arabic numerals to roman numerals in github so I had to backslash-escape before each dot and add breaks, got help from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44619165/github-satanically-messing-with-markdown-changes-666-to-dclxvi))

* Defenders can use intrusion kill chain to think like the attacker to better protect their own system.
* Courses of Action Matrix depicts "who" (e.g. vigilant user, HIDS, audit log) can do "what" (detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, destroy) in the different phases of kill chain. For example, *a vigilant user* may *detect* that an email was *delivered* with suspicious attachments.
* Is there a good way to remember what "zero-day" exploits or attacks mean? I always forget what those mean.
* Defenders want to achieve resiliency.

### 2.

I have learned some basic skills for command line in an another course, [Ohjelmistokehityksen teknologioita](https://github.com/haagahelia/swd4tn023/tree/master/00_linux) and it has a useful summary as well. I am attending another course, [Linux-palvelimet](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/linux-palvelimet-ict4tn021-3018/) that teaches Linux more in depth and managing one's own server. That course runs at the same time as this course.

Karvinen 2020: [Command Line Basics Revisited](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/)

**Comments and notes**

* 'less' - for reading (large) files, use 'space' to move to next page, 'b' for previous, 'q' for exit, '/' for search -> difference with 'cat'?
* In Linux, one can **permanently** store data only in the directory /home/melissa/ (for user Melissa)
* /etc/ has all system wide settings
* /media/ has removable media
* idea behind directories feels simple but needs getting used to (I have mainly used Windows)
* 'sudo' gives high(est) privileges that are needed when installing software etc.

Karvinen 2021: [Install Debian on VirtualBox](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/)

**Comments and notes**

* I have already installed one virtual machine (Ubuntu) but will use these instructions while installing again because I remember having some problems then.

Karvinen 2021: [Install Webgoat 8 - Learn Web Pentesting](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/)

**Comments and notes**

* I have considered installing WebGoat before out of curiosity but got too scared because [OWASP's site](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/), too, warns that my computer will be "extremely vulnerable to attack" but now it is time to dare with these instructions.

# H1, First course week

In the first lesson of this course we learned that security is an adversarial endeavour. During this course we will also gain some hands-on experience with security tools. We will be using Linux Debian 11- Bullseye and WebGoat as a practise target.
<br></br>
For more detailed description of the course and individual homework assignments, visit our teacher's [website](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/). 
<br></br>
First homework consists of reading, making some remarks about them, giving the ["Over The Wire: Bandit"](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) a go, installing Debian virtual machine in VirtualBox, then installing WebGoat and solve a couple of challenges on WebGoat and writing this log or diary about all of the successes and triumphs but all of the trials and tribulations as well. 
<br></br>
I have used some Markdown before but I still need more practise. For recap, I'm reviewing another course's project, [StashHunters](https://github.com/Myyyra/StashHunters), where we made a good documentation for it. I will be using [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as a reference too.

[Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf), chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action

**Comments and notes**

* Conventional network defence tools are insufficient against advanced and **persistent** threats. Defenders need to mitigate threat component risk as well as vulnerabilities.
* Intrusion kill chain consists of

    1\. reconnaissance: research and identify<br>
    2\. weaponization: coupling deliverable with an exploit with the payload (=weaponized deliverable)<br>
    3\. delivery: transmission of weapon, vectors can be email attachments, websites and USBs<br>
    4\. exploitation: triggering intruder's code<br>
    5\. installation: installing remote access or backdoor to establish a persistence<br>
    6\. command and control (C2): beacon outbound to establish "hands on the keyboard"<br>
    7\. actions on objectives: finally doing the objectives in the host like collecting data
    <br></br>
    (btw, the list converted arabic numerals to roman numerals in github so I had to backslash-escape before each dot and add breaks, got help from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44619165/github-satanically-messing-with-markdown-changes-666-to-dclxvi))

* Defenders can use intrusion kill chain to think like the attacker to better protect their own system.
* Courses of Action Matrix depicts "who" (e.g. vigilant user, HIDS, audit log) can do "what" (detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, destroy) in the different phases of kill chain. For example, *a vigilant user* may *detect* that an email was *delivered* with suspicious attachments.
* Is there a good way to remember what "zero-day" exploits or attacks mean? I always forget what those mean.
* Defenders want to achieve resiliency.

### 2.

I have learned some basic skills for command line in an another course, [Ohjelmistokehityksen teknologioita](https://github.com/haagahelia/swd4tn023/tree/master/00_linux) and it has a useful summary as well. I am attending another course, [Linux-palvelimet](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/linux-palvelimet-ict4tn021-3018/) that teaches Linux more in depth and managing one's own server. That course runs at the same time as this course.

Karvinen 2020: [Command Line Basics Revisited](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/)

**Comments and notes**

* 'less' - for reading (large) files, use 'space' to move to next page, 'b' for previous, 'q' for exit, '/' for search -> difference with 'cat'?
* In Linux, one can **permanently** store data only in the directory /home/melissa/ (for user Melissa)
* /etc/ has all system wide settings
* /media/ has removable media
* idea behind directories feels simple but needs getting used to (I have mainly used Windows)
* 'sudo' gives high(est) privileges that are needed when installing software etc.

Karvinen 2021: [Install Debian on VirtualBox](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/)

**Comments and notes**

* I have already installed one virtual machine (Ubuntu) but will use these instructions while installing again because I remember having some problems then.

Karvinen 2021: [Install Webgoat 8 - Learn Web Pentesting](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/)

**Comments and notes**

* I have considered installing WebGoat before out of curiosity but got too scared because [OWASP's site](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/), too, warns that my computer will be "extremely vulnerable to attack" but now it is time to dare with these instructions. 

## a - Bandit oh-five (levels 0-4)

The task was to solve levels 0-4 in the [Over The Wire Game: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

I used Window's PowerShell's inbuilt ssh-feature.

The connecting happens with:

    ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

![login](/assets/h1/overthewire_logged_in.png)

When one level is solved, player must 'exit' and establish a new connection to the next level and switch the part before @-symbol (e.g. with 'bandit1' or 'bandit2'). The idea is to find the password to the next level from the files of the previous level.

During these four levels, I learned some basic skills:

* 'ls -la' shows hidden files (knew this from previous studies)
* If filename starts with '-' (or is '-'), user needs to type '<' before the filename, e.g. 'cat < -' (concatenate file -), other option is './', e.g. 'cat ./-'. Help was found from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42187323/how-to-open-a-dashed-filename-using-terminal). **Edits from class**: if the '<' goes backwards ('>'), you'll overwrite data in the file. Dangerous!. '--' means no flags will follow.
* If filename has spaces, using quotations is needed, e.g. 'cat "name with spaces"'. Help was found from [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/deployment/filenames-with-spaces-require-quotation-mark).
* In one level there were several files where to look for the password but only one was human-readable. I tried just 'cat' for every file until I found the right one. Is there a better way (i.e. how to make a small script that reads all files?) or is there a way to see this from the file types?

The files looked like this:

    bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
    total 48
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 ..
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file00
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file01
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file02
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file03
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file04
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file05
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file06
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file07
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file08
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file09 

My biggest struggle with this assignment was to learn how to copy-paste the passwords to gain access to the next level (not kidding). Eventually, I figured it out. It works just like you would expect (Ctrl+c and for paste right click) but I think my problem was pasting in the wrong 'space'... I blame my touchpad.

**Edits from class**: Added a picture of the terminal when logged-in to Bandit.
**Feedback**: Should have added more pictures of the terminal to show my work. Asked about the 'no-spoilers'- ask that Bandit has.

## b - Bullseye - installing Debian virtual machine

I tried to backup my computer before doing this installation, but it seems that my laptop is not allowed to gain access to neither of my external hard drives for some reason. I decided that figuring **that** out is a battle for another day.

I used the provided helpful [manual](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/) to guide me.

The installation process went smoothly according to the instructions. I installed the [debian-live-11.2.0-amd64-xfce+nonfree.iso](https://cdimage.debian.org/images/unofficial/non-free/images-including-firmware/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-11.2.0-amd64-xfce+nonfree.iso). I do not have much memory left in my laptop, so, I did not allocate as much memory as was instructed but I think I will manage. Only part where I got stuck for a while was when I was supposed to click 'Install' in the Summary- tab. My sad little screen did not show the entire window and therefore I could not click the install button. Finally I realized the little 'fit window to the screen or something'- button.

**Edits from class**: Added the exact ISO I used, corrected my sentence about computer memory, Added a picture of Debian-desktop.
**Feedback**: Should have added pictures of the installation process even though they are already in the manual.

## c - WebGoat, installing practise target

For this part, I used this [manual](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/). My OS is Debian (manual has Ubuntu and Kali).

Installing Java went smoothly. Debian did not have command 'wget' pre-installed, so, I used this [tutorial](https://linuxize.com/post/wget-command-examples/) for reference. 

I installed 'wget' with

    $ sudo apt install wget

And then WebGoat with (from [manual](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/))

    $ wget https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases/download/v8.0.0.M26/webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

Then

    $ java -jar webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

Now, WebGoat is running on localhost:8080/WebGoat. I cut off the internet connection for safety. For the future, I might like to figure out, how to cut off the internet for the virtual machine only. Would that help mitigate the risk for my computer?

## d - Solving some tasks on WebGoat

The tasks for this part are:

* General: HTTP Basics
* General: Developer Tools

The tasks were of adequate difficulty for me. In the very first task where the user needs to find the 'magic number', I was slightly lost. I had a hunch that it has something to do with the site Inspector but I still googled some help ([github issue page](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/issues/494)) just in case, because it seemed kind of cumbersome to try to read the small text in the Inspector. The issue discussion confirmed me that I will find it by searching the code. Only afterwards I realized that I could have searched with the Inspector tool which would have spared me from clicking open all of the divs.

Here are some screenshots from the tasks (the answers change so these are not spoilers):

**From General: HTTP Basics, found the magic number**

Phoning home from console

I feel encouraged to have succeeded in these first tasks and wanting to learn more. 

## Extra

### OTW: Bandit, levels 5-7

**About the commands**:

* ls -la = "The -l option produces long directory listing that in addition to the name contains also information of accession settings, size and the modification dates of the files and directories. The option -a defines that all files, including also the settings files that start with dot (.) character, are listed" ([source](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/env-guide/using-linux-in-command-line/)):

**Goal**:

In level 5, there's one folder (inhere) that contains several folders (maybehereXX) that are listed with 'ls'. The task is to find the password from a file that has three properties: it is human-readable, 1033 bytes in size and not executable. What do learn with 'ls -la'? I learned what all the columns mean by searching online (see below).

    bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
    inhere
    bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere
    bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
    maybehere00  maybehere03  maybehere06  maybehere09  maybehere12  maybehere15  maybehere18
    maybehere01  maybehere04  maybehere07  maybehere10  maybehere13  maybehere16  maybehere19
    maybehere02  maybehere05  maybehere08  maybehere11  maybehere14  maybehere17
    bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
    total 88
    drwxr-x--- 22 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 .
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root root    4096 May  7  2020 ..
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere00 <--- using this line in the explanation
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere01
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere02
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere03

    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere07
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere08
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere09

    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere11
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere12
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere13
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere14
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere15
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere16
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere17
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere18
    drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 maybehere19

**Explanation**

The output table columns mean:

* **First column**: First character (d or -) = directory or file. Also, it looks like the folders are colored blue in the terminal (does not show here), files are green (executable) or white ( "file or non-filename text (e.g. permissions in the output of ls -l) or multi-hardlink file"([source](https://askubuntu.com/questions/17299/what-do-the-different-colors-mean-in-ls))). Example (pointed with the '<--' arrow) has 'd', so, it is a directory. Next nine characters explain the permissions (first three: the user/owner, middle three: group, last three: others (= me and you?)), in the example, the owner can read, write and execute (rwx), the group can read and execute (r-x), others have no rights (---). ([source, about chmod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod)) But what does it mean that I, 'the other', don't have the right to read it? (see thoughts in the fourth column)
* **Second column**: Shows the number of links pointing to the item. In example 2 links are pointing to the item.
* **Third column**: The owner of the item. Example: 'root'.
* **Fourth column**: User group. Example: bandit5. (Wait. So, I have actually permissions of the 'group'. Because I was able to give the password for this level?)
* **Fifth column**: Size in bytes. Example: 4096 (KB).
* **Sixth, seventh and eighth columns**: Modification time. Example: May 7 2020.
* **Ninth column**: Name of the item. Example: maybehere00. 

So, how do I find a file that fits the criteria? I found help from [stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/313442/find-human-readable-files/353879), where someone was doing the bandit05- challenge and had used:

    bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -size 1033c ! -executable

* -size: 1033c, where 'c' is for bytes
* ! -executable: not (!) executable

And that gets you (the right answer):

> ./maybehere07/.file2

Used find- parameters did not include "human-readability". With 'file'- command, one can find out the file type:

> bandit5@bandit:~/inhere/maybehere07$ file .file2

And that gets you:

> .file2: ASCII text, with very long lines

ASCII text means it is human-readable. Using 'ls -la' reveals the right file in this case, too:

![pic](/assets/h1/bandit05_colors_of_the_files.png)

Green are executable (they also have 'x' in the permission column), so, those aren't what we are looking for. Out of the white-colored files, only one is right size (1033), which is a hidden file '.file2'. There we get the right password to the next level.

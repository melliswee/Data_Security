# First course week

In the first lesson of this course we learned that security is an adversarial endeavour. During this course we will also gain some hands-on experience with security tools. We will be using Linux Debian 11- Bullseye and WebGoat as a practise target.
<br></br>
For more detailed description of the course and individual homework assignments, visit our teacher's [website](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/). 
<br></br>
First homework consists of reading, making some remarks about them, giving the ["Over The Wire: Bandit"](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) a go, installing Debian virtual machine in VirtualBox, then installing WebGoat and solve a couple of challenges on WebGoat and writing this log or diary about all of the successes and triumphs but all of the trials and tribulations as well. 
<br></br>
I have used some Markdown before but I still need more practise. For recap, I'm reviewing another course's project, [StashHunters](https://github.com/Myyyra/StashHunters), where we made a good documentation for it. I will be using [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as a reference too.

[Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf), chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action

**Comments and notes**

* Conventional network defence tools are insufficient against advanced and **persistent** threats. Defenders need to mitigate threat component risk as well as vulnerabilities.
* Intrusion kill chain consists of

    1\. reconnaissance: research and identify<br>
    2\. weaponization: coupling deliverable with an exploit with the payload (=weaponized deliverable)<br>
    3\. delivery: transmission of weapon, vectors can be email attachments, websites and USBs<br>
    4\. exploitation: triggering intruder's code<br>
    5\. installation: installing remote access or backdoor to establish a persistence<br>
    6\. command and control (C2): beacon outbound to establish "hands on the keyboard"<br>
    7\. actions on objectives: finally doing the objectives in the host like collecting data
    <br></br>
    (btw, the list converted arabic numerals to roman numerals in github so I had to backslash-escape before each dot and add breaks, got help from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44619165/github-satanically-messing-with-markdown-changes-666-to-dclxvi))

* Defenders can use intrusion kill chain to think like the attacker to better protect their own system.
* Courses of Action Matrix depicts "who" (e.g. vigilant user, HIDS, audit log) can do "what" (detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, destroy) in the different phases of kill chain. For example, *a vigilant user* may *detect* that an email was *delivered* with suspicious attachments.
* Is there a good way to remember what "zero-day" exploits or attacks mean? I always forget what those mean.
* Defenders want to achieve resiliency.

### 2.

I have learned some basic skills for command line in an another course, [Ohjelmistokehityksen teknologioita](https://github.com/haagahelia/swd4tn023/tree/master/00_linux) and it has a useful summary as well. I am attending another course, [Linux-palvelimet](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/linux-palvelimet-ict4tn021-3018/) that teaches Linux more in depth and managing one's own server. That course runs at the same time as this course.

Karvinen 2020: [Command Line Basics Revisited](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/)

**Comments and notes**

* 'less' - for reading (large) files, use 'space' to move to next page, 'b' for previous, 'q' for exit, '/' for search -> difference with 'cat'?
* In Linux, one can **permanently** store data only in the directory /home/melissa/ (for user Melissa)
* /etc/ has all system wide settings
* /media/ has removable media
* idea behind directories feels simple but needs getting used to (I have mainly used Windows)
* 'sudo' gives high(est) privileges that are needed when installing software etc.

### 3.

Karvinen 2021: [Install Debian on VirtualBox](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/)

**Comments and notes**

* I have already installed one virtual machine (Ubuntu) but will use these instructions while installing again because I remember having some problems then.

### 4.

Karvinen 2021: [Install Webgoat 8 - Learn Web Pentesting](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/)

**Comments and notes**

* I have considered installing WebGoat before out of curiosity but got too scared because [OWASP's site](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/), too, warns that my computer will be "extremely vulnerable to attack" but now it is time to dare with these instructions. 

## a - Bandit oh-five (levels 0-4)

The task was to solve levels 0-4 in the [Over The Wire Game: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

I used Window's PowerShell's inbuilt ssh-feature.

The connecting happens with:

    ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When one level is solved, player must 'exit' and establish a new connection to the next level and switch the part before @-symbol (e.g. with 'bandit1' or 'bandit2'). The idea is to find the password to the next level from the files of the previous level.

During these four levels, I learned some basic skills:

* 'ls -la' shows hidden files (knew this from previous studies)
* If filename starts with '-' (or is '-'), user needs to type '<' before the filename, e.g. 'cat < -' (concatenate file -), other option is './', e.g. 'cat ./-'. Help was found from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42187323/how-to-open-a-dashed-filename-using-terminal).
* If filename has spaces, using quotations is needed, e.g. 'cat "name with spaces"'. Help was found from [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/deployment/filenames-with-spaces-require-quotation-mark).
* In one level there were several files where to look for the password but only one was human-readable. I tried just 'cat' for every file until I found the right one. Is there a better way (i.e. how to make a small script that reads all files?) or is there a way to see this from the file types?

The files looked like this:

    bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
    total 48
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 ..
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file00
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file01
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file02
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file03
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file04
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file05
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file06
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file07
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file08
    -rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 May  7  2020 -file09 

My biggest struggle with this assignment was to learn how to copy-paste the passwords to gain access to the next level (not kidding). Eventually, I figured it out. It works just like you would expect (Ctrl+c and for paste right click) but I think my problem was pasting in the wrong 'space'... I blame my touchpad.  

## b - Bullseye - installing Debian virtual machine

I tried to backup my computer before doing this installation, but it seems that my laptop is not allowed to gain access to neither of my external hard drives for some reason. I decided that figuring **that** out is a battle for another day.

I used the provided helpful [manual](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/) to guide me.

The installation process went smoothly according to the instructions. I do not have as much memory in my laptop as was instructed but I think I will manage. Only part where I got stuck for a while was when I was supposed to click 'Install' in the Summary- tab. My sad little screen did not show the entire window and therefore I could not click the install button. Finally I realized the little 'fit window to the screen or something'- button.

## c - WebGoat, installing practise target

For this part, I used this [manual](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/). My OS is Debian (manual has Ubuntu and Kali).

Installing Java went smoothly. Debian did not have command 'wget' pre-installed, so, I used this [tutorial](https://linuxize.com/post/wget-command-examples/) for reference. 

I installed 'wget' with

    $ sudo apt install wget

And then WebGoat with (from manual)

    $ wget https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases/download/v8.0.0.M26/webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

Then

    $ java -jar webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

Now, WebGoat is running on localhost:8080/WebGoat. I cut off the internet connection for safety. For future, I might like to figure out, how to cut off the internet for the virtual machine only. Would that help mitigate the risk for my computer?

## d - Solving some tasks on WebGoat

The tasks for this part are:

* General: HTTP Basics
* General: Developer Tools

The tasks were of adequate difficulty for me. In the very first task where the user needs to find the 'magic number', I was slightly lost. I had a hunch that it has something to do with the site Inspector but I still googled some help ([github issue page](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/issues/494)) just in case, because it seemed kind of cumbersome to try to read the small text in the Inspector. The issue discussion confirmed me that I will find it by searching the code. Only afterwards I realized that I could have searched with the Inspector tool which would have spared me from clicking open all of the divs.

Here are some screenshots from the tasks (the answers change so these are not spoilers):

# First course week

In the first lesson of this course we learned that security is an adversarial endeavour. During this course we will also gain some hands-on experience with security tools. We will be using Linux Debian 11- Bullseye and WebGoat as a practise target.
<br></br>
For more detailed description of the course and individual homework assignments, visit our teacher's [website](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/). 
<br></br>
First homework consists of reading, making some remarks about them, giving the ["Over The Wire: Bandit"](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) a go, installing Debian virtual machine in VirtualBox, then installing WebGoat and solve a couple of challenges on WebGoat and writing this log or diary about all of the successes and triumphs but all of the trials and tribulations as well. 
<br></br>
I have used some Markdown before but I still need more practise. For recap, I'm reviewing another course's project, [StashHunters](https://github.com/Myyyra/StashHunters), where we made a good documentation for it. I will be using [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as a reference too.

1. [Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf), chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action

**Comments and notes**

* Conventional network defence tools are insufficient against advanced and **persistent** threats. Defenders need to mitigate threat component risk as well as vulnerabilities.
* Intrusion kill chain consists of

    1. reconnaissance: research and identify
    2. weaponization: coupling deliverable with an exploit with the payload (=weaponized deliverable)
    3. delivery: transmission of weapon, vectors can be email attachments, websites and USBs
    4. exploitation: triggering intruder's code
    5. installation: installing remote access or backdoor to establish a persistence
    6. command and control (C2): beacon outbound to establish "hands on the keyboard"
    7. actions on objectives: finally doing the objectives in the host like collecting data

* Defenders can use intrusion kill chain to think like the attacker to better protect their own system.
* Courses of Action Matrix depicts "who" (e.g. vigilant user, HIDS, audit log) can do "what" (detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, destroy) in the different phases of kill chain. For example, *a vigilant user* may *detect* that an email was *delivered* with suspicious attachments.
* Is there a good way to remember what "zero-day" exploits or attacks mean? I always forget what those mean.
* Defenders want to achieve resiliency.

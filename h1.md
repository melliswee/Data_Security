# First course week

In the first lesson of this course we learned that security is an adversarial endeavour. During this course we will also gain some hands-on experience with security tools. We will be using Linux Debian 11- Bullseye and WebGoat as a practise target.

First homework consists of reading, making some remarks about them, giving the ["Over The Wire: Bandit"](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) a go, installing Debian virtual machine in VirtualBox, then installing WebGoat and solve a couple of challenges on WebGoat and writing this log or diary about all of the successes and triumphs but all of the trials and tribulations as well.

# H6, Sixth course week

## About last lecture

The course's homepage is https://terokarvinen.com. Last lecture was about peer presentations where course mates presented a topic of their own choosing. I gave a presentation of IoT and security (or lack of security) where I described some examples of occasions where the security was breached. Other topics were: "An information leak from the Canadian Desjardins financial group", "OPSEC - operations security", "Carbanak - the biggest Bank robbery of all time", "Ransomware", "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Open source network stress testing / denial of service applications", "Session Hijacking" and "DMZ".

## H6 Homework, Free ticket

These are the last homework for this course. Next lecture we still have more peer presentations about various topics.

The H6-assignments can be found at [course's homepage](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/#h6).

## x - All reports

**Assignment**:

"
Add links to each homework report. If you have produced any other material in the course, link that too. (this subtask does not require tests with a computer)

## y - Check your references

**Assignment**:

"
In all your homework reports each page, each homework must list all of it's sources. Remember to refer to all of your sources, such as course, task page, reports from other students, manuals, web pages, man pages, conferences... Any direct quotes must be marked as such. You can use quotes, blockquote or similar for this. (this subtask does not require tests with a computer)
"

Added lists of sources in each homework file. Sources were added amidst the text while writing and referencing rules are familiar for me but it is good to remind of this because it is very important. All quotes have been marked as such.

## z - Read (or watch or listen) and summarize

**Assignment**:

(This subtask z does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like)

* A two security conference presentations from different conferences. (This is about 1-2 hours [total] of video for typical conferences)
"
Black Hat [YouTube-channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6q9Ie29ajGqKApbLqfBOg)

### 1.) Eavesdropping vulnerabilities in applications 

I chose a video with the title ["Can You Hear Me Now? Remote Eavesdropping Vulnerabilities in Mobile Messaging Applications"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s44K1IBnw4I).

* Natalie Silvanovich from Google presenting.
* Group FaceTime vulnerability, happened when started a call, added someone to the call, automatically connected to the call without user interaction --> ability to eavesdrop
    * was available through user interface, no special equipment
    * unprecedented, logic bug
* Do they exist in other applications? Silvanovich researched and found examples.
* WebRTC architecture behind conference calls
    * RTC = Real Time Communication
    * a protocol and a specification
    * Used by many mobile application and all major browsers
    * Call started with signalling (info exchanged between peers (crypto keys and codecs supported) ) --> peer-to-peer connection established
    * what goes wrong, peer-to-peer media connection is established before other is ready
    * tracks (= programming construct in webrtc thatrepresents a camera or mic), tracks are added to a PeerConnection and enabled before input is streamed
    * video conferencing apps require a state machine to manage offers, answers, candidates and tracks
        * mistake in state machine can cause a vulnerability or
        * devs misunderstand WebRTC constructs
    * so, what do applications do before the callee answers the phone?
        * when are certain functions called (e.g. addTrack, setEnabled...)
        * messages sent in wrong order, into wrong direction, extra messages, dropped messages
    * Examples of Signal Messenger and Facebook Messenger
        * Root cause is confusion between caller and callee state (Signal) and similar causee of state mismanagement (Facebook) --> allow audio to be transmitted without consent
    * Examples of JioChat and Mocha
        * root cause was not understanding that offers and answers can contain candidates --> audio and video transmitted without consent (misunderstanding WebRTC)
    * Example of Google Duo
        * root cause was incorrect async logic (race condition) --> allowed a few frames of video to be transmitted without consent
* Secure design choice: if you don't do anything before the callee answers, there is no attack surface. Trade-off is that it takes time for the call to connect.

### 2.) Five most dangerous new attack techniques and how to counter them

For the second presentation I chose RSA's video "The Five Most Dangerous New Attack Techniques and How to Counter Them" ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sibeN4U1fOg)).

* Alan Paller (Research Director and Founder SANS Institute) presents Ed Skoudis (Pentesting programs), Heather Mahalik (attacks on mobile devices) and Johannes Ullrich (internet storm center).
* Ed Skoudis:
    * two attack vectors that are seen more and more
        * 1\. manipulation of DNS infrastructure --> company's name does not point to their infrastructure anymore
            * multifactor authentication is 
            * DNSSEC, sign and validate records
            * revoke any bad certs
        * 2\. domain fronting, used to obscure where attacker is located (command and control), attacker disappears into the cloud (organizations trust their own cloud provider but other tenants may be evil)
* Heather Mahalik
    * targeted, cloud individualised attacks (know where you are and going, access to all devices)
        * weak access controls (weak passwords, lack of 2FA)
        * personal info available (b-day, kid's names, nicknames...)
        * practical risk management, Google used as an example
            * review cloud settings
            * follow provided guidelines
            * consider what is public
            * google sends notifications if changes are made
            * don't assume nobody cares about your data
            * don't give away too much
            * be conscious: enable 2FA, review settings, consider permissions, use good passwords
* Johannes Ullrich:
    * balance between security and privacy
    * first topic: DNS over HTTPS (DoH), secure but also bad for network security monitoring/management
        * DoH should not be used on managed enterprise networks
    * other topic: CPU flaws + other systems
        * WiFI/Bluetooth chips are remotely accessible
        * Examples: Marvel Chipset, "Thunderclap"
        * Preventive measures:
            * remove management utilities
            * control access to management network
            * monitor access via management consoles
            * unique passwords for each system

## a - Voluntary, recommended: add a link to your reports as a comment to this page

**Assignment**:

"You might raise in Google, and might also get other people to refer to your work."

## Tips from the teacher

"
* It might be nice to pick one big name conference (Black Hat, RSA conference, HOPE, Disobey) and another you've never heard of
* You can find many security conferences in Youtube, legally, for free, uploaded by conference organizers
* A lot more conferences in https://infocondb.org/con/
* There are some conferences in O'Reilly Learning (former Safari), too
* Remember, no online class on w10. We'll meet on w11 for the final round of presentations, and then it's important to be present.
* The goal of this task is to familiarize you with security conferences; learn how to view them without travelling to the other side of the planet and paying an expensive ticket; and prepare you to keep yourself up to date after the course ends.

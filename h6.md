# H6, Sixth course week

## About last lecture

The course's homepage is https://terokarvinen.com. Last lecture was about peer presentations where course mates presented a topic of their own choosing. I gave a presentation of IoT and security (or lack of security) where I described some examples of occasions where the security was breached. Other topics were: "An information leak from the Canadian Desjardins financial group", "OPSEC - operations security", "Carbanak - the biggest Bank robbery of all time", "Ransomware", "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Open source network stress testing / denial of service applications", "Session Hijacking" and "DMZ".

## H6 Homework, Free ticket

These are the last homework for this course. Next lecture we still have more peer presentations about various topics.

The H6-assignments can be found at [course's homepage](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/#h6).

## y - Check your references

**Assignment**:

"
In all your homework reports each page, each homework must list all of it's sources. Remember to refer to all of your sources, such as course, task page, reports from other students, manuals, web pages, man pages, conferences... Any direct quotes must be marked as such. You can use quotes, blockquote or similar for this. (this subtask does not require tests with a computer)
"

## z - Read (or watch or listen) and summarize

**Assignment**:

"
(This subtask z does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like)

* A two security conference presentations from different conferences. (This is about 1-2 hours [total] of video for typical conferences)
"


## a - Voluntary, recommended: add a link to your reports as a comment to this page

**Assignment**:

"You might raise in Google, and might also get other people to refer to your work."

## Tips from the teacher

"
* It might be nice to pick one big name conference (Black Hat, RSA conference, HOPE, Disobey) and another you've never heard of
* You can find many security conferences in Youtube, legally, for free, uploaded by conference organizers
* A lot more conferences in https://infocondb.org/con/
* There are some conferences in O'Reilly Learning (former Safari), too
* Remember, no online class on w10. We'll meet on w11 for the final round of presentations, and then it's important to be present.
* The goal of this task is to familiarize you with security conferences; learn how to view them without travelling to the other side of the planet and paying an expensive ticket; and prepare you to keep yourself up to date after the course ends.

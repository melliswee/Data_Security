# H3, Third course week

In the third lesson we went through last weeks' homework. Injection attacks are easy to understand but it still wasn't that easy to do them if one does not write down the actual query you're making (i.e. "'SELECT salary FROM employee WHERE tan='113' OR '1'='1';--") and all the options you have already tried.

This week's homework ([course's website](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/data-security-2022p3-ict4tf022-3008/#h3)) includes reading about ATT&CK Framework and Cross Site Scripting (XSS). To understand XSS, we're to write a short story or a comic that describes the attack. Lastly, we learn hacking with WebGoat. 

## z - reading

**Assignment**

"Read and summarize (This subtask z does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like)"

* Mitre 2022: [ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise)
    * Give examples of a single, easy technique in each tactic. Which is the easiest?
    * Explain technique, subtechnique, tactic and procedure. Give example of each.
    * Describe a procedure (a brief description is enough, no need to repeat all steps listed)
* OWASP: [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)


## y - Cross Site Story

**Assignment**

"Write a short story or draw a comic of a cross site scripting attack. Make roles clear: who attacks? Who runs, what code, where? What unauthorized access is gained? (This subtask y does not require any tests with a computer.)."

## a - WebGoat: A3 Sensitive Data Exposure
